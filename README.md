Command line Blackjack


## A Tribute To My Younger Self

The first time I wrote in Java was during my high school computer science class. Looking back, Blackjack was a memorable "into to a new language" project that offered a palatable mix of language basics with a hint creativity.

I wrote this command line Blackjack during a rainy weekend to reminisce in about long ago. Since then and before this moment, the last time I wrote in Java was during my Computer Science 1st year undergrad. What a journey it has been, if only my younger self had been as meticulous about code style and tests!
